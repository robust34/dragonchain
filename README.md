# Dragonchain
The Dragonchain blockchain platform encompasses the development of an internal blockchain platform that provides an secure foundation providing non-repudiation, an network wide common interface, cryptographic capabilities, and efficient distribution of data to the edge.

Dragonchain architecture represents a fast-paced emerging technology foundation for businesses with which to integrate and apply toward identified business problems and use cases. Businesses can develop and track assets more efficiently, deploy the use of cryptographic smart contracts within business workflows to increase efficiency across enterprise systems, and accelerate innovation.

This platform will allow ease of integration for real business applications. There is a growing need for simplified blockchain integration. The decentralized and singular approach to blockchain implementation is sometimes at odds with the real business need to protect information and control business processes. The Dragonchain blockchain platform seeks to solve these needs.

## Project Goals

1. Ease of integration of existing systems 
1. Ease of development for traditional engineers and coders unfamiliar with blockchain, 
distributed systems, and cryptography 
1. Client server style and simple RESTful integration points for business integration 
1. Simple architecture (flexible and usable for unforeseen applications) 
1. Provide protection of business data by default
1. Allow business focused control of processes
1. Fixed length period blocks 
1. Short/fast blocks 
1. Currency agnostic blockchain (multi­currency support) 
1. No base currency 
1. Interoperability with other blockchains public and private 
1. Adoption of standards as they become available (see ​W3C Blockchain Community 
Group blockchain standardization​)

# Setup and Installation

### Python Dependencies

Dragonchain utilized Python 2.7

To install Python library dependencies, run the following:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

### Code Generation

Message classes and RMI services are generated by thrift templates.
If you have Apache Thrift installed you can regenerate these classes by using the gen_thrift setup command:

    python setup.py gen_thrift

### Keys

* Signing Key Generation `openssl ecparam -name secp224r1 -genkey -out sk.pem`
* Verifying Key Generation `openssl ec -in sk.pem -pubout -out pk.pem`


# Execution

## Transaction && Query Service
    python <Dragonchain Home>/blockchain/transaction_svc.py --private-key pki/private-key.pem --public-key pki/public-key.pem

## Blockchain Processor

    python <Dragonchain Home>/blockchain/processing.py --private-key pki/private-key.pem --public-key pki/public-key.pem

    --private-key (required - signing key for transaction service and processing module)
    --public-key  (required)
    --host        (defaults to localhost)
    --port, -p    (defaults to 8080)
    --phase       (required)

## Configuration

Configuration within yaml files within configs directory.

### Environment Variables

`BLOCKCHAIN_DB_NAME` = Blockchain database (also selects `.yaml` config and log file with same name)



# Contribution

Dragonchain uses a standard Feature Branch Workflow.

All feature development should take place in Git branch dedicated to that feature. A feature branch should be named starting with the ticket ID followed by a dash and a short description.

Issues are tracked within Github: [Dragonchain Issues](https://github.com/dragonchain/dragonchain/issues)

## Formatting

Code should follow the [PEP 8 Style Guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for Python code where possible.
